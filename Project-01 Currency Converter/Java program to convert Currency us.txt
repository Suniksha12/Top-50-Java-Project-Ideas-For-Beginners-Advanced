Java program to convert Currency using AWT.

Currency conversion is between INR and Dollar, so assuming that 1 dollar is equal to 65.25 rupees.

Approach : To solve the problem these are the steps to be followed:

STEP 1 : First we will create a frame using JFrame.

Step 2 : Then will create two text fields, two labels and three buttons using JLabel ,               JTextField and JButton.

Step 3 : Name this components accordingly and set their bounds.

Step 4 : Now in order to perform the operation on button click we need to add an Event   Handlers.In this case , we will add ActionListener to perform an action method known as actionPerformed in which first we need to get the values form the text fields which is default by "string".

Step 5 : In order to perform mathematical operations, we need to convert them into double data Type using Double.parseDouble(Object.getText()) and again converting from double to string to place the final value in the other text field using String.valueOf(object).

Step 6 : Finally. for changing the values, we use Object.setText(object), the second object is for selecting which field we want to replace.


We will be using Swing a part of JFC(Java Foundation Classes) for building GUI, with high level of customization and provide rich functionalities.
